`Machine` is a library for creating data workflows. These workflows can be either very concise or quite complex, even allowing for cycles for flows that need retry or self healing mechanisms. It supports [opentelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go) spans and metrics out of the box and supports building dynamic pipelines using native go plugins and [hashicorp](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin) or [yaegi](https://github.com/traefik/yaegi) based plugins by using the providers [here](https://github.com/whitaker-io/components).
